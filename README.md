# CodeAlpha_Iris-Flower-Classification

This Python program demonstrates a machine learning pipeline using the Iris dataset to classify flower species based on their features. It begins by importing essential libraries like pandas for data handling, scikit-learn for machine learning operations, and matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and the unnecessary 'Id' column is removed to clean the data. The input features (sepal and petal length and width) are separated from the target column 'Species', which contains the flower type. Since machine learning models require numerical input, the target labels (species names) are encoded using LabelEncoder.

Next, the dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio. A Random Forest Classifier, which is an ensemble learning method, is then created and trained using the training data. After the training, the model predicts the species for the test data. The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy score, which gives a basic performance metric, and a classification report, which provides detailed precision, recall, and F1-score for each flower species. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the number of correct and incorrect predictions. This matrix is displayed using a heatmap, making it easier to interpret how well the model is distinguishing between different classes. Overall, this code offers a complete machine learning workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.
